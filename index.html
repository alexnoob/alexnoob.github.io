<h1>Basketball GM custom rosters</h1>
<p>Basketball GM is a completely free sports management simulation game. You are the general manager of a basketball team, tasked with building your roster to compete for a championship while managing your finances. <a href="https://play.basketball-gm.com/">Play it here!</a></p>

<h2>How to play with NBA rosters</h2>
<p>You can use built-in rosters: just create a <a href="https://play.basketball-gm.com/new_league/real">New Real Players League</a>. You can start from 1947 up to 2022.</p>
<p>Built-in rosters don't provide players photos and real team names/logos. But you can customize it easily:
<ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/paoti6/nba_teamdata_file_for_historic_rosters_updated/">Real team names and logos</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/ot9e69/historic_players_photos_file_version_12/">Players photos for the 4,784 players available in all historic rosters</a></li>
</ul>

 <li><a href="https://github.com/alexnoob/BasketBall-GM-Rosters/releases/tag/2022.0.5">2021-2022 NBA Roster - version 0.5</a> by alexnoob. Some differences versus built-in rosters: players photos and real team logos by default, added expansion teams and logos evolutions in the future, random salary cap evolution, also ratings a tad more inflated than with built-in rosters (not necessarily a good thing)</li>
</ul>
